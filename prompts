Always read this file first.

I am currently in the process of restructering my website and its design

So there are old and new css, js and html files that are not in sync.
I am replacing it bit by bit. So templates/base.html is the new file

When I ask you for something, please get inspired from my old files, but write new code that fits the new design.
The design needs to be responsive, so it works on mobile and desktop.
Also, the design should be simple, clean and modern, and modular, where I can easily add new components or make changes later.
